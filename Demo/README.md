# UncommonSense.Nav.Automation Demo script

This folder contains a demo script (`Demo.ps1`) that demonstrates some of the possibilities of UncommonSense.Nav.Automation. `Demo.ps1` uses:

- configs.txt - a user-customizable list of all relevant NAV configurations in comma-separated (csv). Each line is a configuration, and consists of the unique configuration name, the full path to the NAV development client to use (fin.exe or finsql.exe), the database server name (if any), the database name, and the user setup (zup) file to use.
