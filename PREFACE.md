###Notes
These functions support virtually all NAV versions - even versions that don't have native PowerShell or CLI (command line interface) support. Due to the technology used, the functions will only work in 32-bit (x86) PowerShell environments.

###Installation
Clone the files to a folder called UncommonSense.Nav.Automation in your module path (typically `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`) to make them instantly available in any PowerShell session.
